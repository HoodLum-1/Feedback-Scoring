# 🚆 Route-Scores
There are a multitude of things that influences the daily experience of commuters on
public transport - congestion and disruptions being the major ones. We believe, that
there are other less visible influences that have significant impacts too.
Route Scores strives to “make the invisible visible” through data, with 
a collection of some anonymous route sentiment scores. The application's task is to summarise
these scores and see if they can help in identifying other influences.
